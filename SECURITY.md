# Security Policy

This security policy applies to the [plaid-ops] project on GitHub.

## Security/Bugfix Versions

Security and bug fixes are generally provided only for the last minor version.

Security fixes are given priority and might be enough to cause a new version to be released.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities.
If you find something suspicious, we encourage and appreciate your report!

### Ways to report

In order for the vulnerability reports to reach maintainers as soon as possible, the preferred way is to use the "Report a vulnerability" button under the "Security" tab of the GitHub [plaid-ops] project.
This creates a private communication channel between the reporter and the maintainers.
